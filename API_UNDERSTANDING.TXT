dekho before starting API testing we should know what is the following
- What is an api
- what is json
- what is get methd
- what is an post method
- what is REStful API
- what is SOAP API
Shall we start now?
Yes ok
API is basically a function aise we se in programs to get some info or thingd to do in program
but they can be called  using aan full URL
Now a  days whatwvere the data is coming to a functional website they work on api only because it can be used at any device like iOS , Android and web
for example lets  say we are making an app like cilrce where we need login right
so these days we crearte an API login which accepts two values username and apssword.
What the api will do is it will pass these parametere to this function and that function will do rest like match with db and response back 

so 
http://www.circlapp.com/api/login

now the parameters can be passed in two ways 

http://www.circlapp.com/api/login?username=riyaarya&password=123456

ifyou see the above url its caled calling an api with Get mthod// wat is mean of this??? i will explai pehle ye dekho  ok

http://www.circlapp.com/api/login

but if you see the above url and still responsing back it is called POST method

clear ril now?

both get amd post are the request method for an HtTp reqyest 
each url hit is called http request  like when we hit na any URL in browser its reqest to server with http protocol
and get and post are two method to pass data to that
let me show you 

dekha 
to each htpp request has two pasrt basically requesta nd response
ok
so these get and post method  are tyoe of request for http 
ok
ok
abhi tak tak clear?
Yes
good now why we need api
to understand it lets see the curretnt technology stack or architecture

1- presentation layer

so this is th pasrt we see like in html  or with angular these days we dont have to look into this. Just understand what the user see is this

2- Business layer

thiis imp because this defines api. Now as to complete any business need we need some functionality and we need data so thsi creates method which fetches data frim db and then guive to presenttation layer to produce result. And these method are called API

3- Database or server layer

This is database or server which hold the data


now we know what is api and htpp requestaand methods

An http response can be wither two type json or html 
the examole i showed you is html response 
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Hello"
  }
]
 abive  is called the json response, so the API are alwyas using json because they vontain huge amount of data and they are light

now if you see the above its looks like hash table or list that we studies in java right?
Ok
each jason has jason object which is enclosed in {} okay which has key and value pair ok
ok
now each json key can also be jason object for example
the examole i showed you is html response 
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "empinof": {
         “empno”:”124”,
         “emp name”:”riya”,
          }
}
]

some time when the data is too complex we get teh very comlex obejcts 
abibe is very simle 



no no any type of url resuest can be hit o on browser get and post we are identifying based n  how we are hitting see thi?
Agar aise hit kare to this is get method and what we did is just a post method let me show you 
i think ye jo website par setup hai isne kuch get setting kiya hai apne apne methd ke end me  go dekh if we are selecting  post its not giving anythung ok buth in get its giving

dont wory about that ist just to autheticate ki coming from reliable source
let  say i hum kisi aur app ka api hit ar rahe hai which is restrctec to company only to in that ye as token on header jata hai ki yes comng from our app only ahi to aise koi bhi kisis ka use kar lega 
and open source ka yahi meaning hota hai
ok but mje post nd get ni aya abi tk
dont worry take it as type of request both are asame bus calling me diff hita in headers post mebina  ek mmin
here you not getting because this is dummy request see this
what hppn?
Are room mate aa haya tha samne 
tok deko ye jo link hai iske after ? Means ye get mthod use kar rahe h
abhi confuse ho jaogi so stick ki these are two methods aof http request 
bus ye jaan lo post is maximum used as it can  have not sure but 512mb of data and get ake bahut kam hita hai  ok
512mb is what are 512 mega bits
means itne data tk can store N?ono trasfer for ecxamoe lets say ki bahut darai pictures load ho rahi hai an and yu sending all picture in encoded format  and if there are huge image to unks encoding bhi jada hoga to ek request me itna data ta trasfer  kar sakta hai?
Okok
ok
nin i ye to basic ho gaya now hum webservice creae karte ha which means creating these api to iske bhi bahut sare type hai
two imp and most used are Restful api or webservices and SOAP Api or webservices
achcha forgot to tell XML use hota tha pehle to data trasfer like we have json na pehle XML use hota tha but that was heavy in nature so its not used anymore but many thord party apps stil support Soa
kuch aaya smajhme ?
Ha
so take these two as two mechanism for ceating webservices
iske detail me you dont have to go as our target is testing 
okay
ok
one more there two main http response are popular 
200- means api is returing successful
400 or 404 – means it is not successfull
ye wala example karege ok
wait..phle psotman nd soap ui p btao na selenium s bd me ye ana jruri h phle
ok dekjo uske liye ek min  ok
where?
Ek min 
ok
now  see yhe differeneve i did not put parameter in url i just put
https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/40a55d80f964a52020f31ee3

but i provided the parameter  and then see the url after clicking send how it looks like
https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/40a55d80f964a52020f31ee3?client_id=B2UXFAE3ATYWTNA0NRWV0XZQXPV0UT3M0JY0CWEMUCCNJV1J&client_secret=DZGP1DYCDZNQVGULYTPGO4JLJ3JXEWSOO5MLOY0ACDU04E53&v=20160201&m=foursquare

but gara ye  app support karta post to parameter put karne ke bad bhi url chage nahi hota
ok

abhi clear ua post and get 
ek br fon p bta dena ok g
ab dekho post man koi rocket science nahi hai maximum use to yahi ho ta hai kyoki we get the response in proper format
so the easily readable ok
ok but ye jo hm postman s api test krte h isme as per response code we say ki api is PASS or fail?
Ok to yes isme sable pahle ek code aat hai ye dekhop
ye status ke base par karyte hai ek ki url chala ya nai 
lets ki abhi maine client key me kuch mita diya and to resut ni aay na kuch and response me see
ye aaya to http send status for request ye implicit ota hai a
now the api developer write their own type of code so that they understand it kuch  log statts likhte hai lkuch log code likhte hai 
to ek to ye do traike hue pass ya fail ke 
and ak hota hai data authetication 
like say fb ka api and i entered my namme and password and it gives me wrong profile name then response to aaya matab status will be 200  but the resukt as we should get is nit the one so it fails
ok
abhi hua clear
ha
good
ab soap ui mujhe dekhna padeha maine soap ui nahi direct service use ki hai 
sokdojo same ai but data presenatti me chnage hota bus
ok
abhi clar hua na api and all 
ha but ek br kl pura fon p bta dena
ok g
abh dekho ye jp program mila tha ye yahi kar rah ahai 
manual me to postman dekho and check kar liya data is correct or not
automation me yahi response ko check karte hai dekho
dekha
